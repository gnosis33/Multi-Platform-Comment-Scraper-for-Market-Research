Layering kicks can lead to phasing issues. Highly recommend just using one and blowing it up in post processing.
Hey what cymatics sample pack did u get that gunshot out of?? Would u possibly guide me in that direction??
Am I able to use any sample for the gun part for some uniqueness?
Sick video
why tf you keep making all those kissing sounds...

Begging you guys to recreate the bass from the second drop of “TRY ME” by Emorfik 🙏🙏
I learned from this video that the long boiiii bass sounds sick at octaves lower.
Lava Lamps xD I used to have one in the 90s
"Hey friends, in future videos can you guys try to volume match the mics 🎙️🎙️ with the DAW volume, please? I keep watching your videos and chasing the volume up and down.  Btw, I fucking love tear out I been having so much fun with the pack.  It&#39;s literally my favorite pack from XLNT.  The drum samples in it are super good as well. Nice and TIGHT. Anyway, amazing videos bros! 🎹🎧🙌"

"Niiiiice, love the tutorial!"
really good tutorial ! 👏
DO YOU LEFT FL 20 ?
Have this be a free project file for those who want to learn tearout
GOT THAT FLOOOWWWWW
I don&#39;t apologize for stating facts that everyone&#39;s doing a tutorial on this same &#39;distorted-noise-sine-sub&#39; bass used by lots of artist across more genres than just dubstep/riddim.
How do you get the pedal audio effect
Great sub!! I&#39;m going to incorporate some of these tips into my go to sub rack
I’ve been staring at that smooth knob for years and just realized there is a smooth knob in serum. Thanks dude.
Thanks man!!
this is some good stuff
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQqPsFIi-s&amp;t=11m30s"">11:30</a> put on  youtube speed 2x is  funny ghost tone type beat amazing !!!"
Is this on soundcloud or anywhere bro?!

Wtf 😭😭😭
"If I could make this into my own song, I would"
"I don&#39;t know much about Dubstep music but after watching this young man&#39;s video and him getting hype, I had to subscribe.  Your track sounds good too.  Maybe I lwill learn more about Dubstep.  Good job!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQqPsFIi-s&amp;t=25m00s"">25:00</a> for those of you who want to listen to the full song on repeat"
This is science.
HOW DID YOU GET THE ABLETON MINECRAFT FONT ALSO THIS TRACK IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE
"I had the exact same expression at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQqPsFIi-s&amp;t=6m38s"">6:38</a>"
First time hearing someone say lex luger like that
That was actually so good
I need this to be out on something!
"This song really got them Mario vibes, plus the dry bones rebuild sound be funny"
This sound like an infekt song a the start
and these melodics damn <br>and actually it is what is it XD<br>reminds of dark mages of dubstep<br>sisto versa automhate ubur prosecute (kinda)Marauda and muerte XD<br>especially sound design is ultra sisto-automhate<br>love it <br>be one of dark side of dubstep XD 😎
"What shortcut did you do at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQqPsFIi-s&amp;t=8m30s"">8:30</a>?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQqPsFIi-s&amp;t=25m01s"">25:01</a>"
Bro I wanted to see how you did that third intro-like part<br>How was the main synth made?
Dude that final result goes so harddddddd
"Any tips on writing baselines? Always found writing them difficult because I feel a need to stick to grid, my bass ends up sounding dumb and lifeless,  Does anyone stick to midi or find it easier to just bounce to audio and rearranged from there!"
Someones been listening to a lot of Muerte
SHEEESH THAT WAS EPIC! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK! 🔥
Ur a genius neddieeeeeeee
BRO THIS IS FUCKING INSANE
beuuhhhwaaaaaaooooow
"That Telephone Bass sounds so Soviet, like that Synth Mick Gordon used for the Doom OST"

ur amp sounds better than mine wtf
What fat rack is that?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQqPsFIi-s&amp;t=6m36s"">6:36</a> MASSIVE Marauda - Cacophony vibes!!!"

when does this come out
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQqPsFIi-s&amp;t=25m00s"">25:00</a> for full listen"
"Heya Neddie. Great vid as always. Can you go in depth about the delay effect at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQqPsFIi-s&amp;t=05m00s"">05:00</a>? Or at least what to search on youtube to achieve something similar"
Wtf
Oh hell nah you better release this badboy
from riddim to tearout
bunda.
"broo wtf, go sit in the corner, that shit was naughty! the switches were insane, loved the intro theme too that got me hype lol"
Solid tutorial dude.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQqPsFIi-s&amp;t=0m34s"">0:34</a> Loompaskettee type heaviness BRUH 😂😂😂"
The first drop has a very high goofy ahh rating.
The last drop 🔥⚡💪
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQqPsFIi-s&amp;t=26m08s"">26:08</a> You went too far with the drop, it is very powerful and perron🔥🔥"
"I BEG YOU ON MY KNEES! I have come back to this video so many times by now, please release it!"
Are you going to finish this up/release? That intro is sexy af
this iis actually insane
Thx for the sharing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can learn more things!!!!!!!!!I follow your Soundcloud also! You music are so different!
"I&#39;m in love with that 3rd drop, I need to hear it released ASAP<br>Great job neddie!! This was a great video!"
Is heaviness in a song subjective?
Lets go!
"I had been trying to create my first indian dubstep song for months, and im still struggling with the first drop, wandering how u did it in 30min lol"
SPOTIFY PLEASE
"Release this plz, i wanna put it in my set"
sick
dawg you need to make that last drop into a full song lmao
never thought i’d hear the phrase “relaxed riddim”
I would put this in a playlist
this is so good I love u
That lead synth is money. Also when that second drop comes in I can see visions of the rail getting broken. Good Work!!!
HOL! would be proud
Bunda
THAT WAS CRAZY
I love how that Piano Intro sounds like you are deepdiving to Chiptune territory and then just gets extremely contrasted. xD
Absolutely disgusting in the best way possible.
Where i can find the phat rack bro?
You didn’t have to go that hard bro
GOT DAM
"I don&#39;t use abelton, but why do you copy and then delete your drop patterns? What purpose does that serve?"
That tearout drop tho goddayum
"That&#39;s gonna be my next project...<br>But I thought in a matter... Starting as some ambiental to melodic dubstep, to reagge dubstep to going all in like Ajapi-IncomingVIP"
this actually insane. good stuff dude
hey neddie. i have question. when u make the perc sounds. when you frequency shift the perc and the key changes does it matter if the sub is still in d# and the perc is some random key?
This is a cool concept and a dope outcome! Nice job
"Daaamn bro, Thats soooo inspiring!"
Probably one of the only few producers on youtube that actually makes really good dubstep that I would hear at a show! Good job!
Sick shit man damn!!!  I like the way you already knew what kind of foundation you were going to need to build the song on.  I need to get better at knowing how to structure a song like that.
bro rocking the target patrick pajamas 🥶🥶
BRUUUH NAAH I NEED A FULL VERSION OF THAT SONG 🔥🔥🔥
mix on the tearout part is messy but the rest is straight fire especially for the time that you made it in
legend
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQqPsFIi-s&amp;t=6m40s"">6:40</a> I agree"

DAY 3 OF ASKING NEDDIE TO MAKE A MELODIC RIDDIM THAT GOES HEAVIER AND HEAVIER <br><br><br>(i couldn&#39;t do day 2 :c)
"I wish the most heavy part reached sadwrist level of heaviness and stepped into experimental/trashwave territory, but this is good enough overall."
"Este broyer es lo matzimo, excelente trabajo bro!"
epicoo
"Yo, I came from deathcore BACK to dubstep last year so im only now discovering heavy artists after getting tired of older dubstep…THIS SPEAKS TO MY SOUL! Following yall on soundcloud asap."
I&#39;m not gonna put my card info in for a free pack. whttf?
Miss may I “ dance with Acura”
But I hear a lot of the ouh-ah-ah-ah-ah a lot in tearout lmao
I feel like Emmure breakdowns would be good to do this technique with.
&quot;it just hardcore break downs&quot; Thats what I&#39;ve been thinking since the very begining and you finally said it!
why doesn&#39;t it allow you to access the cart i just goes back?
Going to Maui this summer haha I’m hype
i feel like this is going to help me tremendously ! i write Trance/dance style music and recently got into Tear out and just does not click on ideas but this! this video is a Goldmine! going to purchase your presets in a bit! thank you!
"Any tips on baseline production or layouts to get more fluent moving lines, does anyone stick primarily to grid lines or do you turn those off,  Do you bounce out midi to sample?"
"What a great idea...thanks for sharing! However, never really struggle to come up with drops or drop ideas...I find it way more difficult to come up with ideas for the &quot;not-drop&quot; parts😵‍💫"
"I&#39;m so glad he said 2008.. As I&#39;m sittin here thinking Emmure,.. and you just said Acacia strain. Subbed."
I try to explain to all my metalhead friends that tearout is the same thing just edm style🤣 and they&#39;re response every time &quot;its too screechy and doesn&#39;t require skill&quot;. I think i need new friends....🤣
sold
How many metal songs are there
I want to subscribe to your Patreon channel. But I&#39;m in Turkey dude
Old School &quot;Lamb Of God - Hourglass&quot; (breakdown part) in Tearout Style is something noone asks but everyone needs :D Great video boys!
ABR has some really complicated stuff. I never really thought about copying those breakdowns. Time to make some color tearout
Poly tear out is sick!! The whole production is gnarly.
"Totally agree, bro!"
you guys are the shit! Seriously! this is why I even like dubstep is because it has a metal feel to it.
also my name jeff
"Yo boys you NEED to suss Kid Presentable for some killer good modern hardcore, heaps of sick grooves that are well worth utilising for this kinda shit"
Whole time other dude tryna play on the key board
on Program inside the screen.
Been doing this technique for a couple months now haha i thought i was the only one. It really is super helpful tho for creating a great flow in tearout tracks!
is it me or is tearout just dubstep
"It’s the little moan after he says “hard” for me 🤣 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XESdpf7VQ0&amp;t=6m25s"">6:25</a>"
"Hey guys nice video&#39;s on your channel, can you guys make a remake of skrillex recess?"
Hello XLNT <br>Can you talk about gain staging? because when I purchased your mid temps pack and opened up the project the mix was heavily clipped!! so is it fine to clip the master when mixing? and after getting right balance by tweaking volume fader can I just through in your masterblaster audio effect?
"Fantastic tutorial, keep up the great videos!"
As Blood Runs Black and Suicide Silence are a couple of my favs from back in the day
"TAS was my favorite band in highschool, you&#39;ve definitely awakened something."
Dam I just moved to maui!
"The &#39;Phenomena&#39; album by Within The Ruins <br>Some Emmure stuff has great rhythms, too"
Acacia strain is lit!!!I saw them in an old pizza place in Bakersfield when I was in high school!!
webutterthebreadwithbutter
Heavy tear out atilla would be tits !
🔥
Thanks. Yo what&#39;s your opinion on those Micromain 27s?  Did you try other when you were choosing?
Thanks for the nugz guys. I love it!
cheat code works can confirm.
My sound daddies have brought home some more face melting insanity! Tearout is S A V A G E
"Love the content but for gods sake increase your voice over volume.... I can&#39;t stand turning up the volume to hear you guys speak, then getting blasted when you play the track... Confused that I have to tell this to a music production channel..."

This is a great video for anyone looking to learn how to layer. You really connected dots for me that helped me understand things better. Im just lazy...haha but great video 😎🤙🏾
"cool, no lie, useful tip"
i like that negativist style intro at the beginning!<br><br>Also really good tutorial. I might wanna try this out for my next dubstep song.

I knew I recognized the voice lmaoooo
Love it bro well done

Where can I get the &quot;pedal&quot; pluggin ? also nice tutorial !!
The bass wasn’t really what I was looking for personally still well done and I stayed because you were fun to watch.
🔥🔥stanky
Lovely harmonics I absolutely cannot get enough of those saturated fat subs in a lot of heavy dubstep now
noti gang
can i get the link for that next video with the other fill? i cant find it and i need it
Hey Letsynthesize ! Very great stuff :) Did you made a tutorial about the long &quot;main&quot; bass ? :) Or one about the snare you re using ? :)
I hate that aggressive intro
KEEEN!!
I like that you did this so quick. Looking forward to the next one a lot as that was the sound that really grabbed me.
Great tutorial as always! Thank you. Also editing is on point:)
The best synth tutorials on the Tube :)
More videos on free plugins
Please make bass from free plugins to the surge
Thank you Dan :)
Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"For those who want to have the wavetable; its a bit tricky to make, you can put osc A sine wave, then select sync and go to MENU on the top right near master knob and select Resample to OSC A; now remove the sync option and you should have a similar shape, then just go to WT editor and fade the edges and remove every other WT that doesn&#39;t fit the shape"
I&#39;m waiting for the course! 😊 Hope the course is for all the versions 🤖❤️
Nice video! Very helpful! ! =))
nice one again dan :)
"Thank you,mr.Dan. Now I can make Tearout Dubstep. Very great tutorial ❤️❤️❤️"
For that push and pull - check out some tracks by Figure... one way to affect all the stems together without much hassle would be after original stems have been created. So basically remixing your song after you have completed it. I think Skrillex does this a lot too.
"&quot;just move this here to change the delay&quot;<br><br>me, who uses fl studio: 😓"
Great analysis. Ty
so fuckin sick
"Awesome vid!! Really takes a minute to hear everything in a marauda track, homie is on another level"
"Hi, I&#39;m MARAUDA 2 :)"
"take a listen to MARAUDA - CACOPHONY, my brain melted listening to that sound design."
That sub did go ham tho lmaooo
You are giving away some secrets my boi
DKKAY does it better.
"Although D&#39;LION isn&#39;t as famous, I think he is as ahead of the game as Marauda. And D&#39;LION makes tearout AND deathstep.<br><br>I don&#39;t understand why there seems to be two separate communities for deathstep and tearout."
"i agree with a lot of this. a lot of it is from metal tho witch i love. a lot of people knows these tenecks on how to make basses they just dont know how to make videos for it. and if they do they has no following to got it to a big group of people to learn. <br><br> in a lot of the best brackdowns in matel are slower (take a song like BRIMSTONE HEART by METHWITCH where there is a tempo drom into the first brack down then tempo drop again to slower to make it even heavyer. i know this is unreasonable to do in the seen rn (ive been told off for bringing my track in 140 to 110 just this week XD) but its really the best way to have a heavy drop hit) so having a slower tempo is really good for making someting groove like this. <br><br>also dragging on basses is really good for more of a way to exstend the entisapleon. i know akvma does a lot of stuff by hand and dont quontises it (look at her fallout remix, them basses be dragging halla hard) <br><br>backgound mellodys in drops is someting hella over looked in songs and its just adds so much more then a atmosphere. Lord of Flies by Shrine of Malice does this is a fast melody in the back <br><br>ive always hated dubstep snare cuz they sit to high and dont care about the beef in the mids and they just lose a lot of power in them. some one like deathflore does their snares really well. <br><br>silense is halla important. vr even said that. its just hard to make sound right. im youll hear that all the time in metal. take Reign of Darkness by thy art is murder for an example of that. <br><br>also the f*** it is from LORNA SHORE - To the Hellfire XD. everyone uses that now tho."
dude ty for making this. like you said it blows my mind that imo no one comes even remotely close to to reproducing his sound design. keeps me up at night how does he do it lol
Its eptic too
I love the energy man lmao i never meet people irl that are this intense about music. I just wish i understood music enough to get stuff like this.
Love the mindset... We gotta get better.
"ikr? I mean respect to everyone trying their best making tutorials on sounding like him, but nobody will ever come close except maybe code:pandorum, it&#39;s an art and you can&#39;t just become the person that makes the music they make<br><br>edit: but you did it, realizing the rest of those notes aren&#39;t on time made me realize how perfection ruines my drops lol, I should try it<br><br>btw kicks he and code use are probably vengeance deep house kicks, I&#39;m 100% sure the kicks they use have nothing to do with dubstep sample packs<br><br>whaaaaaaaaaat, the sub tips were awesome, what I can tell you I discovered is he sometimes makes the sub go down in volume dinamically, I forgot in which song, but it made sense, it created energy"
this sounds more like hybrid trap for some reason. idk lol
i think the pitch from the sub is the attack of it that goes from up to down and the longer the bass goes the higher the pitch attack comes
"pretty sure the delay in these predrop basses is the &quot;sidechain&quot; leftover for the drums, or delayed in purpose for the drums, just without drums"
"When i first heard the song, I thought the sub in that part was Eptic, but I may have been mistaken, you can hear it clearly when the pitchbend starts going wild."
Versa mvda nosphere agony...  People are catching up jus like they did to Skrillex
Intro song? :o
"Bro I keep watching this video….<br><br>Love how you broke this down in epic detail..<br><br>It really is a fucking Masterpiece how He does this. I know TRAMPA is on his throne, Grinning how his prototype is DOMINATING!<br><br>Like you said bro, Experiment with sounds, and GET TO WORK!<br><br>In the Lab NOW AF…"
I fucking Love Marauda tracks…<br><br>Never disappoints… <br><br>I strangely get possessed to write lyrics to his shit tho… <br><br>You can’t rock a festival without bumping at least 5 of his tracks <br><br>On God
Absolutely Humble.
"Finally, someone who gets it lol"
Ma routa
{ There is not a good or bad in music }
the first id you showed released today lol
this is the eptic collab. Marauda not only has a unique sound but his grooves just haven&#39;t been replicated. i cant figure it out but no one can get close to making his flows or sound. it always comes out sounding like heavier riddim. blows my mind him and SVDDEN DEATH
Here before Arsen 🤣
"Bruh I heard this on his ig I tried to show my brother n it was gone. But here it is you have it, once again coming in clutch"
I agree with u man hahaha. This guy is a monster in mastering and drop arrangement.
Bro I love how hype you get about his work lol you&#39;re like an archeologist inspecting an ancient relic
Good analysis cheers
"Its funny😆 listen to the end of battlefields by zomboy, its the real tearout😆"
TIME TO GET TO WORK!!
pa cuando el video de como masterizar pa souncloud :(
Gracias por tanto mi rey
"Te das cuenta que no sabe lo que hace cuando te dice que necesitas el izotope para saber el volumen de tu track, teniendo el medidor más completo &quot;SPAN&quot; 🦍<br>En la parte donde corta los sub graves esa técnica no siempre se usa de hecho hay que tener cuidado, las explicaciones que da son vascias y con poco sentido... Por ejemplo en la parte cuando corta los altos del track, le quita la calidad mucho antes de siquiera subir su track mejor estudien o busquen &quot;el rincón del mastering&quot; ... Hasta ahora es el único canal que realmente sabe lo que hace, saludos."
"Uffffff, ta wenardo el vídeo!!!<br>Estaría mamalon que hicieras un video de cómo hacer drums para tearout, como el snare o algo así"

"Hi, you have very cool content. Wouldn&#39;t like to make a hyperbounce tutorial?"
"could you do a tutorial on compression in teraout/dubstep? Basically showing the best settings for the most common sounds in the genre, machine guns, sustains, growls etc. Sometimes being shown examples is a good way to learn"
"NGL, kinda keen to use this as jumpscares in my game? aha"
"ooh those reverb swells with the sustain is Sauce bro. Great idea, you are very talented man. Definitely a fan. Much respect."

"Under appreciated project, my Christmas 2022 was made - tyvm"
"You should do a tutorial on how to make Drumstep music (optional). Since you’ve made tutorials about Dubstep &amp; DnB (Drum &amp; Bass), how about a subgenre of EDM that combines the two, if you want to. 😇💻🎸"
"The reason why Tearout has some Heavy/Death/Thrash Metal instrumentals in it is because of how this genre is heavy mix of Deathstep, Riddim &amp; Brostep. The Deathstep in the mix is what has Tearout having the Metal instrumentals. 🎸🤟🎃🔥"
"Bro! This was so sick! I’m a kiwi that’s getting into producing this genre, absolutely love it. If you ever chill in discord bro would love to grab any tips and get opinions and shit while your making your stuff and vice versa!"

"Damn, thats still pretty sick"
"I liked the contrast between your music and the background music, huh) Thank you for the tutorial!"
"Hi, thanks for this tutorial. I don&#39;t quite understand how you crunch the sub and the top noise together though. Do you just need to make them play together while compressing them?"
"Love this sound! Very heavy stuff man, thanks for the video"
fm is awesome
"HOW TO MACHINE GUN IN VITAL, and  just shows you his Vital plugin not telling How TO MAKE IT"
"so I am brand new to music production (got my first daw 3 days ago) really want to start learning how to make tear-out and riddim. I clicked your link and seen the $16 a month with a discord, is there any one on one teachings or help? or is it mostly just access to information, and would there be classes? also I use the Reaper DAW are your teaching for specific DAW&#39;s or any works?"
"your videos changed my entire workflow, and i love how this applies very well to any daw, since i am a fl user, &lt;3"
"When I try to create the top sound it sounds so small, nothing compared to the video. I recreated all effect chains and the vital sound the same but it still sounds like a small pluck:("
god the intro was stupid what is this 2013?
what is the song in the intro
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL5I2ME8wZo&amp;t=0m28s"">0:28</a> Why does this guy suddenly go full Jens Kidman"

this is actually insane though
Heavy af! Top notch as always!
omg a tear out tutorial that actually sounds like a tear out bass? noice!
"Tearout dubstep is so agressive, it grows on me, I like it more and more :D"
Dope sound and awesome heavy drop!! Much to be gleaned from this process for making some killer aggressive tracks.
epic
Ngl that tearout track was sick
Magic like always :)
yo! i love your videos Dan. Really helped put sound design into perspective for me. im really excited to get that tearout start to finish. keep up the good work. thank you
great tutorial again
"At first I felt Vital sounded very flat... It almost had like a plastic sound to it when I put it side by side with Serum. However, once I started opening up Vital and really getting crazy with tons of LFO&#39;s filtering, randomization, and just endless ideas I began to see why Vital was going to be another key synth in my arsenal. And it is FREE?!?!?!?! I did rent to own for Serum for at the time it just made sense, but I will take FREE any day and now my sound design sessions are just blowing up every time I play with it!"
yoi
Dan thank you for everything. 3 of your classes deep. I love them so much!
ya boi
Sick tutorial👌🏻
WOOOW!!! THAT&#39;S WHAT I NEED!
Can you do the same tutorial but in serum? Vital doesnt work well for me and crashes when I try to open it.
best machine gun tutorial on the internet!
I love you videos man! I already bought the tarot course and am going through it currently. A lot of great stuff. Hope I get to win another class!
Big sound!
Awesome tutorial! Keep up the great work 🔥🔥
Good one💯
how someone can so creative
A machine gun that shoots ogres for bullets 😳
"I wish I could pick up on what you are doing in Vital easier. I&#39;ve tried pausing to dial everything in, but I&#39;m not sure where everything is supposed to be connected to or dialing it in. I&#39;m giving up on this one after putting in enough effort to where it stopped being fun.<br><br>I really enjoy your other tutorials in Vital. I&#39;ve had good success with them. Thank you for everything."
"Im trying to recreate the patch that you showed for the CHARACTER and I just cannot get it to sound right. I got the crunch layer and sub sounding just like yours, but the character layer sounds super weird on my end! All parameters are nearly identical to the ones you showed, even playing the same not, but I couldnt see everything in the patch. Even so, I cant even get my first oscillator to sound like yours even with all the processing!"
Vital is a gamechanger
These tutorials are pure gold.
yea this was powerful
Time to make some phace inspired dnb
It sounds dope even in a dnb track.
Pls make a sustain screechy bass in Vital!
"Wow, that&#39;s so close!"

You guys honestly have made me the producer I am today. Thank you for everything you do!
"Bruh I see Oli, I click"
Ayoooooo Lets fuckin goooooo
"Hey, man! I just want to say thank you so much for showing us how to step up; it helps a lot of us beginners get started. I do have a question regarding setting cue points. For example, I tend to set one of the cue points at the drop and another 8 bars before it. My question is, let&#39;s say there are lyrics before the drop such as &quot;let&#39;s get reckless.&quot; Do you set the cue point on that lyric, or do you still place it at the drop? What do you recommend?"
"Yo, this is sick my guy. I know I&#39;m a little late to the party but this was super helpful, thank you."
great mixing!
I am just starting up on Dubstep and what I call the Broken Beat Genres. Most of what we do on our very amateur channel is 4 to the floor styles. But this helps and is actually mixed.
What DJ Pool do you use?
i cant find polar bear or ooph tracks
"Good stuff, over been DJing for 28 years, I still please bass and tech house, other genres as well. Although I don&#39;t play this genre, I still do a lot of doubling, but I&#39;m usually leaving both tracks fully eqd and chipping back and forth, I see why with the l this genre you do what you do. It gives me lots of great ideas for my bass house mixes. Love seeing the over the top view, you can tell you know your equipment and when to eq and use the faders. Top notch"
"Holy shit, this actually opened my brain on how to improve my dj skills! Like my shit is so basic with transitions and thats SUCH a badass and creative way to make EVERYTHING more interesting!!!! Holy hell i have alot of work to do, a million times thank you!!! Would you be able to make a vid or respond on how you transition out songs????"
Bro this is one of the most detailed and useful tutorials ive seen so far. Im only a 1.5-2 yrs in and haven&#39;t felt confident enough on my drops or the sound quality of my mixes to be interested in making it a second career. Now I know some areas im drastically going to be able to improve. 🙌🫶🙏 Thanks bruddah!!
"i don&#39;t usually leave comments but absolutely loved this breakdown and tutorial, tysm fr &lt;3"
"such a gr8 breakdiwn 4 sure. Great visuals with mixer and track phrases...i usally have both subs on even one at 9 oclock, one at 12 oclock and chop as required."
"This helped a lot, but wtf was that at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu7BiyzGc20&amp;t=15m20s"">15:20</a>? Lol"
"Your hot cues method is what I’ve been looking for a while now, I went and tried it as soon as I finished watching the video and my transitions were so smooth, thanks so much man"
Best dubstep double drop tutorial that helped me A - LOT ❤TY SO MUCH for this AMAZINGLY most helpfull video i&#39;ve seen today 👏🫶good job bruh and keep up the dj tutorial work!
"Tried the mental training, and got distracted by the bangers being played. Had to rewind a min  LOL! Thanks for the great tutorial!"
Fire video for someone just starting out thank you so much!
"This was actually sick, thanks."
Please keep posting. I’m learning 😮
Where’s your go to place to get remixes? There’s definitely songs I wanna use but YouTube and SoundCloud are some of the only places I can find them
"This was really helpful, thanks!"
"How do you save your starting point when you load your songs . I keep trying to look that up and can’t figure it out . I understand you set the cue, and possibly hit memory , but the next time I load the track it just wants to start from the beginning anyway .. what am I doing wrong ? And just to be more clear , I have hot cues set and I can click them to start from where I want. But I want to know what you did, it saves time"
"Thank you, I found this extremely helpful dude I appreciate you so much"
The one thing I found out when I was messing around with doubles some doubles can be different keys but they just sound good together it’s just trail an error really finding songs that double well together
"This is such a nice breakdown, I started to figure out doubles on my own but didn&#39;t have enough experience to know the proper way of doing it. Huge help thanks!!!"
"Awesome vid man, cool to watch you work."
what fx was used to bring out the fitz song
this is SUPER helpful! thank you
This video helped me out so much. Thank you for making this
"7 if its ripped and sounds weak just put it in a daw and turn it up, fuck rule 6 sync is for the losers or wannabe&#39;s, i have a double that breaks rule 3 and works fine but every other track yah i can see that and trying it out before watching the video."
Video = Big pimpin... How long have you been dj&#39;ing for?? I just bought the ddj rev 1 a few days ago (first controller) still tryna learn doubles (obviously) but they sound so mucky however the tip of filtering out one songs lows i think will be very helpful just don&#39;t know what songs to try it on.
what’s the best way to find songs in the same key?
I see lots of dudes doubling with their lows both up. And even now after all of this time people still talk mad shit in sync but I utilize it a lot when I’m doing routines live! It really does help.
that was sick bro !!;
Bro that was such a good learning video 🤯🫥🫡
This shot was fire I learned alot
"That’s such a cool Dj style bro, I rate how smooth your trans are 👑"
great video! I&#39;ve always wondered how the pros did it.
could you say some examples of double?
Aye thats my song! :)
"So I have a ddj400 I bought awhile back and wanted to learn. Anyways I stopped trying and started going to raves and ab to goto my first festival this Saturday. <br><br>Anyways I’m trying to get back into it now that I have this love for the culture. I’ve got rekordbox and I use my SoundCloud for the music. <br><br>Is there a better place to get these riddim, bass, etc. songs? Thanks!"
"just listened to &quot;my name is skrillex yesterday&quot; for the first time in years, makes me remember how much I used to love dubstep, (even thought that kinda felt like midtempo) Anyways keep it up dude! those gains are getting out of control XD"

Now I gotta watch thru your other videos to find that growl starter / fill lol that one sounds nice
This is the process I use to layer my bass as well. Lots to get wrong but when done correctly it sounds great! Thank you for the extra insight on this technique 🙏

Why does my bass (not sub) sound stay a one shot when I try to go make midi notes? I try to sustain the note and it just wont
Amazing tut but completely unrelated.. whats the house tune in the background of the intro of the video? :D
"brew your videos are actually such a big help for noob beginners, love how you explain stuff in detail and really map it out. Please don&#39;t ever stop making content <br><br>having a weird issue with the free drip TT download though :( when I go to use it on the sub it says in red only audio effects can be placed on this kind of track. <br><br>im not sure if because I&#39;m on into abelton that I can&#39;t use it on my tracks .... if you could help me out that would be mint.<br><br>thanks once again my guy :)"
"YHA, DAMM  DUDE YOU SO SMART LOL ! AMOR G FOR THE SCHOOLING 👍"
"When I group like at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrQ6kneb80M&amp;t=6m45s"">6:45</a>, I don&#39;t hear the sound after that. Please help me, I can&#39;t figure out what the problem is :("
You are the fucking best g
"why does your sub sound so low? i have to put it down 3 octaves manually, trying to replicate it in vital instead of serum"
BANGERRRR. YOU&#39;RE GETTER BETTER AND BETTER AT THIS SHIZ
very very very nice!
Damn bro...that was some insights nobody tells..heavy shitt 🔥
I like that bass I’m gonna implement this in my stuff!! Well done once again my brother
Dude I’m absolutely binging your videos. Your helping me so much man. Every video is gold. Thank you so much bro👊🏻👊🏻
"I&#39;d love to download this but the youtube compression seems to have made the sound a little muddy, any possibility for a download link? fucking sick mix bro"
How to alienpark pls new revelation riddim producer
Great vid and ur song is fire g
shit was hard
Thank you... I would suggest to people to look at Artfx tutorial on snares too.<br>😁👌
Snare theory 101 is my favorite class
Amazing video!
"&quot;You have to make sure you don&#39;t have too much reverb in your snares, you gotta control the space, control the reverb.&quot; Lol, you guys and your tutorials :) Can&#39;t deny it sounds good, will have to watch one of your mixing videos to see how you fit it all in, cheers."
Great video 👍
"hey dude! great video. if you don&#39;t mind i can share one lil advise: instead of adding tonality this way, just try using high tonality sine wave on serum or smth.<br>because the way you show it here, you actually ruining the impact of the punchy snare."
YoOOOOOOOOOOOO welcome 😂😂🤘
Damn so much knowledge lmao mfs gonna get mad but you a saint
And is there a place to download or get this project? I don’t know if you do that or not lol
"So goood. I just want to know how to make a track sound glued together. I’ve never been able to make my mixdowns sound like others and so that hinders every other part of my production, in my head"
Great video
"Noice, just what I needed :)<br>TY!"
Sick sample
omg
sick stuff man
Where can i Find the layer plugin?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyuJvRXvBLE&amp;t=26m20s"">26:20</a> had me rolling!! Great trick that also works for woodworking. Hell I bet it even works in Ableton!"
That drop is heavy
Another awesome tut!! Thanks again
why is everyone and their mother using Disableton? Should I switch to it from FL Studio as a beginner?
bro how long you been producing for?
🙌🙌👍
great video
Absolutely love this. Can’t wait to practice this on my song!!! One question. And it may be a obvious question lol. But what is the difference between transient and tonal
"this is very poggers, you sir are based."
this is the fucking best tutorial that i ever seen！ keeping it up man you did a nice job for us to learn！
"How tf don&#39;t u have 10k subs yet bro? These videos are gems g dammit, bangers"
Great tutorials it would be dope to see how you get an idea down to a midi track or just anything honestly!
Jeez you are amazing thank you for the great tearout tuts!!
another big thank you!!!!
"very good video, thank you for that!"
Drip your an angel sent from above I swear 🥹
Wow you explain so well. You should have over 1 million views
I spend a month reading music theory in a book and feel lost&gt; or I can have you help me understand in 35 min. I hate reading. I really like all your help.
music theory for dubstep? I&#39;m In!
Cheers.nice and concise.I used to play flute to grade 8 &amp; have just started practicing again.I&#39;m certainly out of practice!also being monophonic it&#39;s difficult to know all about scales.thanks
it&#39;s my fortune to meet u~!
YAY! Now I actually know a method for writing melodies instead of just trying to do it by ear!
Time to get more melodic kids
let&#39;s see this proper ting
WOOOOOO been waiting for this frfr.<br><br>Cracked as always.
Thanks for that thorough tutorial 🙏<br>Shit was dope!
"This video is great, just wish I didn&#39;t have to drop an extra $300 on plugins to try to emulate this as a beginner. Currently researching free alternatives to all of these plugins lol."
This track is sick af. Heavy alien vibes. Lil mf givin battle commands to their alien brethren/sistren.
Do you do 1 on 1 lessons?
"hey there, so i&#39;ve been getting into making music &amp; I&#39;ve been hooked on dubstep lately but i just don&#39;t know which platform to buy &amp; start off with and how to put the samples into them&gt; can you guys help me out pls?"
can you get lux to do some free flps
Fantastic Video.
"Amazing video bro, ive watched so many different videos but you explain the concept very well, keep it up g"
Badass Sample &amp; Serum pack!!! Keep the tutorials coming much respect! I’m gonna buy that pack fersure
"its cool to see some serum presets, i do mostly all my sound design in serum, cool to see bigger producers are still using it."
DANNY IZ THE GOAT
"Как же я обожаю ваши туториалы! Вы лучшие)) <br><br>Каждый раз, когда я начинаю испытывать творческий кризис, я просто смотрю ваши видео и получаю так очень много идей для моей музыки. Я буквально заряжаюсь вашей энергией и начинаю снова творить! Спасибо вам)"
Yup. This is the key thank you
Hahahaha you made my day
"Killer video guys! I&#39;ve experimented with tilting a sine wave towards a saw or square wave (like with a smooth-morph on a basic shapes wavetable) but drawing harmonics in with the wavetable editor is some next-level precision.<br><br>Any idea what the typical method is when it comes to using pitch modulation is? I&#39;ve found that using the pitch envelope really helps give a heavy punch to machine gun basses, but it doesn&#39;t quite sound right when I use the same sub under other basses in a track. Would you guys use separate subs, automate the pitch envelope on and off, or just use the same sub throughout?"
Simplicity soft
"Wow what an acNice tutorialevent! Best of luck for the rest of your future, I’m looking forward to being able to invest when I turn 21 in November!"
I am getting back into production after so ti and tNice tutorials makes it so easy to understand. Thank you so much for making these videos.
Great nugs! You&#39;d want to do this in linear phase mode right? Or does it matter as long as its not phasing with the kick?
thank you
"Need an edit of this video with the nug of knodge music. because this video was filled with nugs throughout. Great video as always. Can&#39;t wait to see what you boys come up with next! parker, hair&#39;s looking strong my guy!"
&quot;Producers don&#39;t want you to know this trick&quot;😅😅
cool guyz💙💛<br>please do the video remaking Odesza style next time🙏
Do you guys gainstage? I think it’s an avoidable extra step
XLNT always bang🔥🔥❤️<br>Love ur videos<br>Can I get free sample <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>😂Just joking
"Tear out sample pack is fire and so is this channel , big ups !"
Just bought the pack. Amazing stuff guys!
"Danny matrix and Parker red pill, hackin shit again"
I want my 21 minutes back
Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to lowpass the track and recreate the waveform in serum by drawing it in?
LOVE  THEEEEEEM
Danthony &lt;3
"be careful matching the volume of the sub frequencies of a finished reference track to your own sub, when you&#39;re using the levels of a track that has been mastered and limited to compare to your own unfinished mix, it can cause distortion issues down the line when you go to mix and master your own track. Using the EQ matching technique to edit and mimic harmonic ratio as you guys did is a great tool, but lowering the reference tracks volume, and mimicing the ratio when the volume is lower, will allow you to raise and lower the total volume later to fit your own track better."
you guys are seriously amazing. The amount of FREE content Danny and Parker provide is top tier.
"If you really want to make it simple, zoom in on the waveform first and see if it&#39;s a sine or a triangle wave.  A lot of these guys are using triangle waves like Danny says, with pitch envelopes for tearout subs. You can see the pitch envelope in the Fabfilter spectrum, and on the waveform... that&#39;s why it&#39;s dropping down a bit sort of like a kick on the analyzer, probably an octave.  Then, if you want to make it more tonal so it comes through on smaller speakers, boost somewhere between 500-2000 hz to bring up some of those harmonics."
Nice &lt;3
DADDY LIKE
the bass in the intro is so heavy OMG!
oh shit u made OTT!!!
That daw is cancer
"If this is what you call dubstep, then I think this genre might die soon"
Me too
following this account was the best decision i’ve made in months
that hurt tf out of my ears
50 OTTs later still not crispy enough
how can you create chase the moneys 808 or  access the distortion or saturation used
My grandma makes dubstep
"Reminds me of a yheti track, this is niceeee"
HOLY SHIT! THIS IS FIRE!! FIRE AS IN A DUMPSTER FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🗑🗑🗑🔥🔥🔥
sounds so bad
I tried this button mash in audacity and it sounded like hadou-ken with OTT
nice Riddim pl8
dubstep is trash
I learned something today.<br><br>🎉 Button Mash. <br><br>U have made decent basslines and melodies by button mashing. Then subtracting and adding
&quot;To the average person this sounds horrible&quot; <b>plays an insanely fire sound</b>
bro quickly made better music than I will ever make
&quot;there&#39;s this plugin that I INVENTED&quot; hahahah fire
Sounds terrible
&quot;Bro this beat finna get us out the hood&quot;<br><br>the beat:
Its slow and alot of field recording etc with concepts in mind with room for happy accidents its all about experimentalization...
SpongeBob: &quot;i think mr.krabs is a.... Robot&quot;<br>Mr krabs in his office:
S💾ftware prolly feelin&#39; drunk🥴n&#39; clanky with this assigned design to sound intoxicated or under the influence?👍
There’s people who know music and for everyone else there’s dubstep 😂
"LMAO, you did not invent the ott, you don&#39;t even have Ableton."
this shit is the funniest thing ever
@eliminate
Thats so random 😂
bro revealed all the secrets to humanity
New son for Disciple when?
where do you get the wavetables?
this aint it
🔥🔥🔥 WE MAKING IT OUT OF THE SPACE SHIP🔥🔥🔥
Alien ahh beat💀👽🔥
"Хуета , кровь из ушей"
We ain’t making it out the hood-step
Button Masssssshhhhh lol. Noted
Bro looks so unhealthy wtf
"certainly  sir i felt constipated, i had to poo two times after this video"
Im just bad at producing
bro casually flexes creating ott 😂
"Like, whatever ya sayin&#39; bro but FFS...... WHY IS EVERYBODY USING WANKY FL STUDIO???  Why won;t that shitty DAW just die already"
Soltan?
Idk but she so fine to me 😩🤤
You actually designed OTT? If so you are an actual legend!!
bro that melodic part was actually kinda fire
This is legit max autism gen z music
Is dis shit out?
"You are such a good artist, just throw at a wall and if you like it; you like it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ that’s all that really matters"
vital better than serum now?
Dude what 😂😂😂🥵🥵🥵
This is….. terrible….:.
&quot;there&#39;s a plugin i invented called ott&quot;<br>that shit got me creasing
"Ah, yes, the vital wave tables that are like cheating"
Real
i wish it was that easy lol. every time i sound design i end up overprocessing the sound and it sounds terrible
&quot;and then you just&quot; <b>proceeds to do 100 things and his homework at once.</b>
I thought sound design was totally crazy too until I started doing it.. It&#39;s complicated but not as complicated as I once thought. Tech has helped a lot too.
Only 5 OTTs? Why the restraint?
Bro discovered wavetables.
bro is allergic to lfos
OTT OTTOTTOTTOTTOTTOTTOTTOTT💀
just put 5 ott ez
@the1lilyert
Stick a Sausage Fattener on the master bus and call it a day 😜
Dude that is so fucking true. Sound design is just &quot;twist random ass knobs till it sounds good&quot;. My latest obsession is vocoding shit.
Garbage
"it was good at the first half sounded like UKF/Excision type beat, then at the end it sounded like all the other dubstep past 2016, no...2017... i&#39;ll be nice."
YOU invented OTT??? Is that really true? I use it myself :)
Dupstep fans are honestly wild
I didnt know steve started making dubstep
Legend 🙌
Lost me at “plug-in I invented called OTT”. No sir
"bro please tutorial on how you made the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2eK8nGKG4w&amp;t=0m24s"">0:24</a> part its so fucking fire"
trash
"OTT , that is a cool plug..  steve duda you are a genious."
at least its ott and not soundgoodizer<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>although i kinda think soundgoodizer might do a good job as well
Sounds so generic
u have destroyed dubstep. embarassing
loompatrix...nah nvm bro ☠️☠️
this to me is the equivalent of putting dyed milk in my ass and shitting it onto a canavas and calling it art. yes thats a real thing.
Put ott on master buss for extra effect
Bro randomly clicked the automation and made the new disciple release 💀
&quot;theres a plugin i invented called ott&quot; 💀
I rather become deaf than youtube shows me this again wtf
????
i don&#39;t have ott :^(
Wtf
Hahaha 😂❤❤
"You ever just get into a like state of hypnosis doing automation work, like you&#39;re hearing the same loop over and over but you&#39;re making it slightly (or majorly) different and it&#39;s just a vibe? lol. Sound design is fun"
Sounds like straight ass every time
Bad dubstep was so 15 years ago... Americans are so damn late with EDM. It&#39;s like a ancient relic here in Europe lol
"No idea what the synth plugin is since I&#39;ve been using only serum and default sampler for the past 3 years, but this presrt seem too raw"
I knew everyone in the comments was gonna unironically say this is fire... 😂😂
Bro those first OTTs made me think of something Virtual Riot would make 🔥 something color bass-y y’know?
WE LISTENING TO SOME METAL PIPE MUSIC 🎧💥🎶🔥💥📣📣📣📣🔥🔥
Bro went from future riddim to nuerostep in a few seconds
And this is people who have no clue they are doing thinking it is good. If you need 5 of the same anything you absolutely suck. Please stop
Why is the master volume on every preset in your tearout pack ready to detonate my monitors and blow up my entire block?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7H7P2VMnVs&amp;t=6m39s"">6:39</a> lmaoooo had two projects lying around where I couldn’t get that last touch on the bass and was trying to create that release with reverb. Soemtimes you overlook the simple things"
id do a group high pass instead of removing the bass on that final tip. also forgot to mention the groove. Tearout is nothing without a proper groove. them basses need to be delayed.
sick
anybody got a link to a PHAT RACK?
Thanks for the nugsss bro &lt;3
Intro Track ID?
do a version of this but for the plugin Vital
"Great content as always, please do DATSIK turtorials"
"I find if you set the delay to seconds and not note values, you can get even more metallic control! anything from 3ms up to like 50-60ms sound super good and give you a TON of diff tones"
"Very comprehensive tutorial, I could actually follow and understand this easily. Keep em&#39; coming!"
throw that bass through a convolver...oh wait thats FL
Yo can you make &quot;angels landing from isoxo&quot; That might be wrong name. But it&#39;s soo crazy plz make that plucky lead remake 🤩🤩
Sick!!
ρɾσɱσʂɱ 🔥
this really came together when you just started throwing in samples on top of the patch. FINISH IT!. I&#39;D LOVE TO HEAR AN XLNT TEAROUT TUNE!!! great work as always guys
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7H7P2VMnVs&amp;t=7m45s"">7:45</a> was the sickest sound I’ve heard yet. Keep it👍🏼"
"Literally none of this is dubstep. Not hating, just facts"
LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!!!
"Love what you two teach, and your fun teaching style. Always look forward to your vids!"
The bois are back with the heaters!
sounds like shit
Could you do a dank video about what&#39;s a good breakfast to have to help with production?
Just started getting into the Tear Out pack.... gaaaaaaaaahdaaaaaaam!
Thanks for the knowledge and sounds ⚡️
"yo, is the intro song available on any other platform, like spotify? If so, what&#39;s the name? It&#39;s fucking sick"
bruh
Yee yee!
You should consider playing the end result first so people know if they’re interested
Love This!!! Please more Tearout/Heavy Dubstep sound design!!!
"invisible limiter G3 , TOP"
Luv u fucxers
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7H7P2VMnVs&amp;t=13m08s"">13:08</a> pissed my pants"
"The OGs of Tearout if anyone wants to see the roots of the subgenre are Trampa, Sadhu, OG Getter, Rekoil, Barron (RIP💔), Midnight Tyrannosaurus, Genetix, FuntCase, Cookie Monsta (RIP💔), and several others from that Era."
Easily PhaseOne tracks Like Inevitable Outcome are the best tear out imo
"I mean, Svdden Death is no longer Tearout"
If we put unison at maximum in the effect of serum... That not just fucked mono compatibility ?
"i don’t even listen that much to Tearout, but i think the sound itself is pretty dope"
Marauda is my fav
SAMPLIFIER IS ANOTHER GOOD STYLE BASS
u guys rock 😎
no shot u called excision a tearout artist
LMAO
Hell yeah I was waiting for this shit
Give us more some tearout content 😩
Was that an airsoft gun sound in the beginning  😂
Would love to see some drum and bass stuff
😤🏆🔊
Nice guys thanks
"Can you guys do a video about drop structure, particularly how to write w/ better flow and complementary sounds? Really liked Nitepunk&#39;s nug of nodge about creating a &#39;sentence,&#39; was hoping you guys could go more into depth about that."

I need that sub video !!! That would be fire !!!!
You guys are awesome! Thank you so much for these videos!
Dveight is the only guy i know lol. I make house music 😂🤣
Parker looks like a handsome Bubbles
"some people to checkout if youre new to Tearout: Nimda ,Marauda , Dkkay,  Joeb , Akvma, Stvg , Rinzla, Mvkuta, Antima, Redzy (even tho idk if its deathstep or not but i guess its tearout bec of too much guns), Oddprophet, Dveight, Agony, Dr. Lobster, Decrime, Disinety and basically everybody who is on the indefiniteLabel and had a track on the Malignant Album&#39;s. Theyre all Fucking Talented! people!"
You guys are the best!
"Oddprophet, Samplifire, Marauda, D3V, Code Pandorum (technically deathstep I guess but whatever) are goated.... just my opinion"
I love riddim
the energy on you guys.....amazing
"awake at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7H7P2VMnVs&amp;t=00m18s"">00:18</a> lol, just watching this, nbd"
thank god im not the only British logic producer making tearout!
Love this video sir. I keep rewatching it to help with my structure
This video would be awesome if you really took in the system of what hits where but from a perspective of the count of four and the hits similaritys as the bars move forward through the song
thankew
Thanks for the tutorial! I am wondering what your intro song is. And I suggest removing the background music so I can focus on what you are saying a bit better. In my experience all the tutorials without background music I absorbed the info better. Cheers
"I&#39;ve been getting stuck on arrangment with my dubstep tracks and this has helped me so much, thank you brooo"
Thank you! knowing thins makes it really easy to get started and avoid being overwhelmed
Thanks man keep it up
Brostep is my favorite subgenre :]
Solid tutorial man keep it up
thats not dubstep
"Thanks man! I&#39;ve been getting feedback that arrangement is the main thing I need to improve on, so I really appreciate this."
Very informative! You really know your stuff! Thanks🙏🏼

Does complextro count as brostep?
"What a wholesome moment to see and hear UK drill, Jump-up DnB, and Complextro songs in this compilation 💀"
"This time I see that you have not made a mistake anywhere, although it could have been better if the garage could be in the house guide, and with this it started with the speed garage, I don&#39;t know but it is only a suggestion, but I do notice that You have forgotten to put breakstep, which was like an intermediate point between 2-step and dubstep, which is why it fell into total oblivion in 2008, when dubstep began to gain relevance and popularity, and I also see that you have forgotten about put purple sound, which would be a combination between synth-funk, g-funk, and chiptune and video game music, and of course a bit of dubstep, and you also forgot to put chillstep, which together with melodic dubstep emerged partially, and also to color bass you have forgotten to add, and also to dungeon sound that would be known as dark dubstep!!!<br><br>PS: the one with the wubstep, sounds more like chipstep!!!"
Where&#39;s dubcore?
&quot;Trapstep&quot; is actually called Hybrid Trap
that transition from tearout to melodic dubstep was clean!
"yeah, this is BS"
"Melodic Dubstep, Chillstep, and Glitchhop dominated my childhood. They still stand out imo, especially Melodic Dubstep."

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4VJB9G2PpQ&amp;t=1m53s"">1:53</a> this is Complextro which is a subgenre of house."
Where is uk bass and uk bassline? I would put them after dubstep
"Aren&#39;t you mistaking Reggae with Reggaeton for the Reggastep section, im pretty sure the description you make is of Reggae, Reggaeton is kinda different..."
Future Bass has nothing to do with dubstep or garage

Both “riddim” songs you have are just modern brostep to be honest. Better examples would be “INFEKT - Projectile” for some really riddmy riddim. And then “INFEKT - Endless Party” for a more modern version of riddim. There’s definitely some other inaccurate genres but you completely struck out with the riddim part lol
Wtf even is this.... Smh ....
Correction. It&#39;s Trench bro 🤣
"Na this is pretty wrong, grime isn&#39;t a sub of dubstep, and digga d isn&#39;t isn&#39;t grime lmao, and you have no idea what riddim is either lol"

"Your descriptions absolutely crack me up, great video! I totally agree with your omission of the sub-subgenres.<br>Btw do people consider complextro under house despite its very dubstep-y sounds? obviously that makes sense since complextro is short for complex electrohouse but I still feel a tinge of sadness that it&#39;s never mentioned in these videos when glitchhop does!"
"Informative, thanks!"
What is the difference in melodic bass?
