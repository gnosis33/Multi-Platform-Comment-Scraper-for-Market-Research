Multi-Platform Comment Scraper for Market Research
This project is designed to collect consumer feedback from multiple platforms using comment scraping, with the goal of helping businesses identify pain points and trends in customer experiences. The current implementation focuses on YouTube, but future iterations will expand to scrape comments from Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Yelp, Twitter, and Google Reviews.

By aggregating feedback from these platforms, the tool aims to provide valuable insights for market research, allowing businesses to better understand customer challenges and improve their products and services.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
This tool scrapes consumer comments from multiple online platforms to identify common pain points. The current version works with YouTube, but the architecture is designed to support other platforms in the future.

The scraping process consists of:

Fetching Video or Post URLs: Searches for relevant content on supported platforms (currently YouTube) and saves the URLs.
Scraping Comments: Uses APIs or web scraping techniques to extract comments from the fetched URLs.
Saving Comments: The collected comments are saved into CSV files for analysis.
üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your machine.
API keys for the platforms you want to scrape (YouTube is supported in the current version).
Basic understanding of APIs and web scraping.
Environment Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/comment-scraper.git
cd comment-scraper
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your API keys for the platforms you plan to scrape:

Create a .env file in the project root and add your API keys. For now, YouTube is supported:
makefile
Copy code
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
Ensure that your platform credentials are correctly configured to avoid any issues during the scraping process.

üìã Features
1. Fetching YouTube Video URLs
The script allows users to search for YouTube videos based on a keyword or search term.
The video URLs are saved in a urls.csv file for future use.
2. Scraping YouTube Comments
The tool scrapes comments from YouTube videos using the YouTube Data API.
It saves the comments in a structured CSV file format (output/ folder) for easy analysis.
3. Multi-Platform Support (Planned)
Amazon Reviews: Scraping product reviews to gather customer opinions.
Facebook Posts/Comments: Extracting feedback from Facebook posts and comments.
Instagram: Scraping comments and captions from Instagram posts.
Reddit Threads: Collecting feedback and discussions from Reddit threads.
Yelp Reviews: Aggregating reviews to understand customer satisfaction on local businesses.
Twitter: Scraping tweets and replies to analyze consumer sentiment.
Google Reviews: Collecting reviews for various products, services, and businesses on Google.
Each platform will have its own API integration or web scraping logic to extract comments and feedback data.

üîß How to Use the Tool
1. Fetching YouTube Video URLs
The script fetches YouTube video URLs based on a search term and saves them to a CSV file.
Example usage:

python
Copy code
youtube = initialize_youtube_api()
search_term = input("Enter your search term: ")
video_urls = fetch_video_urls(youtube, search_term)
write_to_csv(video_urls)
2. Scraping YouTube Comments
Given a video URL or video ID, the tool will scrape comments from that video.
Example usage:

python
Copy code
video_id = input('ENTER_VIDEO_ID: ')  # Replace with your video ID
api_key = os.getenv('YOUTUBE_API_KEY')
comments = get_youtube_comments(video_id, api_key)
write_to_csv(comments, video_id, 'youtube')
3. Extending to Other Platforms (Future Development)
The architecture is designed to easily integrate scraping from additional platforms by creating specific modules for each platform.
For each platform, a similar workflow will be used: fetching relevant content, scraping comments, and saving them into CSV files.
üì¶ Dependencies
os: For interacting with the operating system.
csv: For handling CSV file operations.
dotenv: For loading environment variables (API keys).
googleapiclient.discovery: For interacting with the YouTube Data API.
requests: For making HTTP requests (will be used for platforms like Twitter, Instagram, etc.).
Install the necessary dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
üöß Future Features
API Integrations for Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Yelp, Twitter, and Google Reviews.
Sentiment Analysis on scraped comments to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.
Pain Point Detection: Use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to highlight recurring consumer issues.
Data Visualization: Generate reports and graphs to represent trends and common issues in consumer feedback.
Multi-Language Support for scraping and analyzing comments in different languages.
üéØ Goal
The ultimate goal is to build a market research application that consolidates consumer feedback from various online platforms. By using comment scraping, businesses can uncover valuable insights into customer pain points, enabling them to improve products, services, and overall customer satisfaction.

üõ†Ô∏è Planned Expansion
Amazon Reviews: Scrape reviews for products to analyze consumer opinions.
Facebook Posts and Comments: Extract feedback from user posts and comments.
Instagram Comments: Analyze comments from Instagram posts.
Reddit Threads: Gather user discussions from relevant subreddits.
Yelp Reviews: Collect customer reviews for local businesses.
Twitter Tweets and Replies: Analyze public tweets and replies.
